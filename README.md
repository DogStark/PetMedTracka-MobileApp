The PetCare Mobile App is a companion application for pet owners, designed to provide easy access to their pets' medical records, medication schedules, and vet appointments. By scanning a QR code or logging into their account, pet owners can view and manage their pets' health information on the go.

This app integrates seamlessly with the PetChain Web Platform (for vet hospitals) and PetChain Smart Contracts (for secure, decentralized data storage).
